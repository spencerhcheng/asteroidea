# Asteroidea - Social Fitness App Roadmap

## Project Overview
A social app for creating and joining running/cycling events with real-time features, location services, and community interaction.

**Tech Stack:** Flutter + Firebase  
**Target Users:** Runners and cyclists looking to connect and organize group activities

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Specification

### 1. Event Management System

#### Event Creation & Joining
- [x] **Basic event creation** (name, date, time, location, distance, pace)
- [x] **Event editing/deletion** with user confirmation
- [x] **Group size limits** (optional, display on event cards)
- [ ] **Friend invitation system**
  - Search by name/phone number
  - Invite via SMS with app link
  - In-app notification system for invites
  - Accept/decline invitation flow
- [ ] **Public event joining** (one-click join for public events)
- [ ] **Event capacity management** (prevent over-capacity joins)

#### Event Discovery & Display
- [x] **Basic event filtering** (running/cycling, upcoming/hosting/open)
- [ ] **Advanced filtering**
  - Location/zip code search
  - Date range selection
  - Skill level filtering
  - Distance preferences
- [ ] **Event detail page** (modal with X to close)
- [ ] **Participant count & profile pictures** (show 5 + overflow indicator)
- [ ] **Map integration** for location-based discovery

### 2. Social Features

#### User Connections
- [ ] **Friend/follow system**
  - Send/accept friend requests
  - View friends' public events
  - Friend activity feed
- [ ] **Event recommendations** based on preferences and social graph
- [ ] **User search** (by name, username, phone)

#### Communication & Engagement
- [ ] **Event commenting system**
  - Text comments with timestamps
  - Emoji reactions (preset options)
  - Real-time updates
  - Infinite scroll for long comment threads
- [ ] **Post-event features**
  - Photo sharing
  - Event reviews/ratings
  - Stats sharing
  - Achievement tracking
- [ ] **Notification system**
  - Friend creates new event
  - Event invitations
  - Event updates/comments
  - Push notification infrastructure

### 3. Location & Tracking

#### Core Location Services
- [ ] **Meeting point display** (current implementation)
- [ ] **Zip code/area search** for event discovery
- [ ] **Map view** for events in area
- [ ] **GPS tracking opt-in** (button to start/stop sharing location)

#### Cost Optimization Strategy
- **Prioritize Google Maps usage:**
  1. Event detail view (single location pin)
  2. Area discovery (when user explicitly searches)
  3. Avoid: Real-time tracking, route mapping (use alternative APIs)
- **Alternative solutions:**
  - OpenStreetMap for basic mapping
  - Device GPS for tracking (store locally, sync periodically)
  - Geocoding only for zip code â†’ approximate coordinates

### 4. Performance & Scalability

#### Database Optimization
- [x] **Event creator name denormalization** (avoid N+1 queries)
- [ ] **Pagination implementation**
  - Event lists (infinite scroll)
  - Comment threads
  - Friend lists
- [ ] **Efficient querying strategies**
  - Composite indexes for filtered searches
  - Geographic queries optimization
  - Cache frequently accessed data

#### Cost Management
- [ ] **Firebase usage optimization**
  - Minimize real-time listeners
  - Batch operations where possible
  - Implement pagination to reduce read costs
- [ ] **Image optimization**
  - Compress profile photos
  - Progressive loading
  - CDN implementation
